This repository contains code and other supplementary data to accompany the preprint *Pin the loop taut : a one-player topologame* by Christopher-Lloyd Simon and Ben Stucky, which is available at [insert arxiv link](arxiv.org). The most accessible information here is in the form of catalogs of pinning sets of multiloops, available as pdfs in the folder catalogs/. The file ```planeloop.py```, which contains the code which was used to generate these catalogs, also contains implementations of the algorithms described in the aformentioned preprint.
