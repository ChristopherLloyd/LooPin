This repository contains code and other supplementary data to accompany the preprint *Pin the loop taut : a one-player topologame* by Christopher-Lloyd Simon and Ben Stucky, which is available on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16216). The most accessible information here is in the form of catalogs of pinning sets of multiloops, available as pdfs in the folder [catalogs/](https://github.com/ChristopherLloyd/LooPin/tree/main/catalogs). The file ```planeloop.py``` contains the implementations of the algorithms described in the aformentioned preprint as well as the code which was used to generate the catalogs.
