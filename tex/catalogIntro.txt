\section{{Introduction}}
This document presents exhaustive data about the pinning sets of certain unoriented multiloops in the unoriented sphere - {}. The reader should refer to the authors' forthcoming paper \cite{{Simon_Stucky_pintheloop_24}} for an explanation of the terminology used throughout this catalog, and for a detailed description and analysis of the algorithms used to compute all the information displayed here.

Section \ref{{sec:stats}} presents statistics for the dataset at a glance. We focus in particular on computing statistics related to degrees of regions appearing in pinning sets. The data is presented in tabular form by number of regions and by pinning number in subsections \ref{{sec:byRegions}} and \ref{{sec:byPinning}}, and in graphical form in subsections \ref{{sec:byNumRegionsGraph}} and \ref{{sec:byPinningGraph}}. Note that the number of multiloops by region matches \cite[{}]{{oeis}}. 

Section \ref{{sec:multiloops}} contains detailed visualizations of the pinning sets of every multiloop in the database with at most {} regions, and tables describing some of their individual statistics, with emphasis on degree. For each multiloop, optimal pinning sets are labelled with capital letters and colored using shades of red, and the other minimal pinning sets are labelled with lowercase letters and colored using shades of green. For better visibility, we do not plot the entire pinning semi-lattice; rather, the sub-semi-lattice generated by (taking unions of) minimal pinning sets, together with the set of all regions. The heights of vertices in the semi-lattice (and the labels therein) correspond to their cardinals. A lighter edge emphasises a greater difference between its endpoint's cardinals.

The multiloops in this catalog were generated with \texttt{{plantri}} \cite{{plantri}} and drawn with \texttt{{SnapPy}} \cite{{snappy}}. For each multiloop, we include its \texttt{{plantri}} code and planar diagram (PD) code in case the reader wishes to study it using either program.
